# Co-Creative Canvas - Troubleshooting Report

## Current Issues (Critical)

### ðŸš¨ **TLDRAW Canvas Not Rendering**
- The TLDRAW canvas is completely invisible/not loading
- Users see a blank white area instead of the drawing canvas
- This makes the application completely non-functional

### ðŸŽ¨ **CSS Styling Completely Broken**
- No styles are being applied to any components
- All UI elements appear unstyled (default browser styling)
- Navbar, buttons, and overlays have no visual formatting
- Tailwind CSS appears to not be loading/working

## Root Cause Analysis

### **CSS Import Chain Issues**
1. **TLDRAW CSS Import Problem**
   - Originally: `import '@tldraw/tldraw/tldraw.css'` in component (failed)
   - Changed to: `@import '@tldraw/tldraw/tldraw.css'` in globals.css
   - TLDRAW CSS may not be loading properly, causing canvas to be invisible

2. **Tailwind CSS Not Loading**
   - All custom styling depends on Tailwind classes
   - If Tailwind isn't loading, entire UI becomes unstyled
   - Possible Next.js build/compilation issue

### **Layout Structure Problems**
1. **TLDRAW Container Approach**
   - Changed from fullscreen overlay to contained div approach
   - TLDRAW may require specific positioning/sizing to render
   - Container constraints might be preventing TLDRAW initialization

2. **Z-index and Positioning Conflicts**
   - Multiple approaches tried for overlay positioning
   - CSS conflicts between TLDRAW internal styles and custom styles

## Failed Attempted Solutions

### **Approach 1: Overlay CSS Classes**
- Created custom CSS classes with high z-index values
- Used `!important` declarations extensively
- Result: Still had visibility issues

### **Approach 2: Navbar + Contained Canvas**
- Redesigned to use navbar with contained TLDRAW
- Changed TLDRAW from fixed positioning to relative
- Result: TLDRAW canvas disappeared completely

### **Approach 3: CSS Import Location Changes**
- Moved TLDRAW CSS from component import to globals.css
- Result: Broke both TLDRAW and Tailwind styling

## Technical Environment Issues

### **Multiple Dev Servers Running**
- Multiple `npm run dev` processes were running simultaneously
- Could cause port conflicts and build cache issues
- Server logs show successful compilation but broken rendering

### **Next.js Build Cache**
- `.next` cache cleared multiple times
- Fresh builds still showing same issues
- Possible persistent compilation problems

## Current Server Status
- **Server:** Running on http://localhost:3000
- **HTTP Response:** 200 OK (pages load)
- **API Endpoints:** Working (TTS, Canvas Save return 200)
- **Rendering:** Completely broken (no canvas, no styles)

## Impact Assessment

### **Severity: CRITICAL**
- Application is completely non-functional
- No drawing canvas visible to users
- No UI styling makes it unusable
- All collaboration features inaccessible due to missing canvas

### **User Experience**
- Users see blank/broken page
- No visual feedback or interaction possible
- Professional appearance completely lost
- Demo/presentation not possible in current state

## Recommendations for Resolution

### **Immediate Actions Needed**
1. **Revert to Last Known Working State**
   - Restore previous working version from git history
   - Identify exact commit where canvas was visible

2. **CSS Debugging**
   - Check browser dev tools for CSS loading errors
   - Verify Tailwind CSS compilation
   - Test TLDRAW CSS import methods

3. **TLDRAW Integration Analysis**
   - Review TLDRAW documentation for proper setup
   - Test minimal TLDRAW example in isolation
   - Identify required CSS/JS dependencies

### **Systematic Approach**
1. Start with basic TLDRAW canvas (no custom styling)
2. Confirm canvas renders and is interactive
3. Gradually add custom UI components
4. Test each addition to identify breaking changes

## Files Requiring Investigation
- `src/app/globals.css` - CSS import issues
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Layout structure problems
- `src/app/components/Canvas/CollaborativeCanvas.tsx` - TLDRAW integration
- `next.config.js` - Build configuration issues
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind compilation issues

## Next Steps
**DO NOT ATTEMPT MORE CODE CHANGES** until:
1. Root cause is properly identified
2. Working baseline is restored
3. Systematic testing approach is established

The application needs to be restored to a functional state before any further feature development.
