**Demo URL**: http://localhost:3000 (BROKEN - see TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
**Status**: APPLICATION COMPLETELY NON-FUNCTIONAL - URGENT FIX NEEDED

## üîß URGENT RECOVERY NEEDED

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **STOP ALL CODE CHANGES** - No further development until fixed
2. **Restore Working State** - Revert to last known working version  
3. **Fix TLDRAW Canvas** - Essential for any functionality
4. **Repair CSS Pipeline** - Restore Tailwind and component styling
5. **Test Systematically** - Verify each component before proceeding

## üö® CRITICAL RECOVERY PLAN

### Priority 1: RESTORE BASIC FUNCTIONALITY
**BEFORE ANY OTHER WORK CAN PROCEED:**
- [ ] Get TLDRAW canvas visible and interactive
- [ ] Restore Tailwind CSS styling
- [ ] Verify basic drawing functionality works
- [ ] Test that pages load with proper styling

### Priority 2: SYSTEMATIC COMPONENT RESTORATION
**ONLY AFTER Priority 1 is complete:**
- [ ] Restore AI button functionality
- [ ] Fix generation overlay styling  
- [ ] Test Gemini API integration
- [ ] Verify end-to-end AI workflow

### Priority 3: COLLABORATION FEATURES
**ONLY AFTER Priority 1-2 are complete:**
- [ ] Firebase real-time sync
- [ ] User presence indicators
- [ ] Voice annotations with ElevenLabs

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT RESTRICTIONS

### FORBIDDEN UNTIL FIXED
- ‚ùå **NO NEW FEATURES** - App is completely broken
- ‚ùå **NO UI/STYLING CHANGES** - Styling is completely broken  
- ‚ùå **NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES** - Last changes broke everything
- ‚ùå **NO PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS** - Nothing works to optimize

### REQUIRED APPROACH
- ‚úÖ **Restore working state first** - Essential before any work
- ‚úÖ **Test each change individually** - Identify exact breaking points
- ‚úÖ **Document every change** - Track what works/breaks
- ‚úÖ **Focus on core functionality** - Canvas must work first

## üìä Current Status Summary
- **Functionality**: 0% (Nothing works)
- **UI/UX**: 0% (No styling applied)
- **Core Features**: 0% (Canvas not visible)
- **Demo Readiness**: 0% (Completely broken)
- **Urgency Level**: MAXIMUM (Hackathon deadline approaching)

**CRITICAL**: Application went from working to completely non-functional. Immediate recovery action required before any development can continue.
